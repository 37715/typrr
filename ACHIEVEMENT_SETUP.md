# 🏆 Achievement System Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the new WPM-based achievement system with stacking rewards and beautiful badges.

## Features Added
- ✅ **14 WPM Achievement Tiers** - From "First Steps" (20 WPM) to "God Mode" (200+ WPM)
- ✅ **Stacking Rewards** - Earn all achievements up to your highest WPM
- ✅ **Beautiful Badges** - Color-coded, animated badges with gradients
- ✅ **Profile Integration** - Achievements display on user profiles
- ✅ **Real-time Notifications** - Animated popup when achievements are earned
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - See next achievements to unlock

## Installation Steps

### 1. 🗄️ Database Setup
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# In your project directory:
cd database/schemas
# Copy the content of achievements.sql and run it in Supabase SQL Editor
```

This will create:
- `achievement_types` table with all 14 WPM achievements
- `user_achievements` table to track earned achievements  
- Helper functions for checking/awarding achievements

### 2. 🚀 Restart Your Development Server
The API has been updated to check achievements automatically:

```bash
# Restart your API server
node api/server.js

# Your React dev server should auto-reload
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

### 🎯 **Automatic Detection**

- **Stacking rewards**: If you type 78 WPM, you get ALL achievements from 20-75 WPM
- Achievements are awarded instantly and saved to your profile

### 🎨 **Visual Experience**
- **Profile badges**: All earned achievements display on your profile
- **Progress tracking**: See upcoming achievements and your progress
- **Animated notifications**: Beautiful popups when you unlock new achievements
- **Rarity system**: Higher achievements have special effects and animations

### 📊 **Profile Integration**
- Achievements section shows all earned badges
- Progress bars for next achievements to unlock
- Current WPM determines which achievements you qualify for

## Testing the System

1. **Complete a typing test** at any WPM level
2. **Check the console** for achievement messages
3. **Visit your profile** to see earned badges
4. **Look for notifications** after completing tests

## Troubleshooting

### No achievements showing?
- Ensure the database schema was run successfully
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're logged in when completing tests

### Achievements not triggering?
- Check that API server is running (`node api/server.js`)
- Verify database functions exist in Supabase
- Look for SQL errors in Supabase logs

## Future Enhancements

Ready to add more achievement categories:
- **Accuracy achievements** (95%+, 99%+, 100%)  
- **Streak achievements** (daily practice streaks)
- **Language-specific** achievements (Python master, etc.)
- **Special challenges** (fastest improvement, consistency, etc.)
